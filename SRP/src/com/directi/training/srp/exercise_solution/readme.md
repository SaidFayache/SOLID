###Single-responsibility principle


`
Classes should have a single responsibility and thus only a single reason to change.
`

The single responsibility principle (SRP) states that every class or module in a program should have responsibility for just a single piece of that programâ€™s functionality. Further, the elements of that responsibility should be encapsulated by the responsible class rather than spread out in unrelated classes.
